This is a simple random number generator. Enter a value under 100 into the input field and press the generate button. 
The computer will then generate a random value between 1 and the number you input into the field. For example, if you
input 17 into the field, the computer will generate and display a number between 1 and 17. Use this tool to randomly
select students in your class by inputting the number of the last student in the classroom based on the class register.
For example, if the student at the end of the register is number 17, enter the number 17 into the input field. Have fun
using this tool to more fairly select students at random!
